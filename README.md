## Javascript Exercises

The Odin Project description: "These are a series of javascript exercises intended to be used alongside the curriculum at 'The Odin Project'. They start simple and easy, but get more complex and involved as you progress through them."


These exercises are intended to help fix the content on JavaScript fundamentals. The main topics they cover are:

- Arrays
- Loops
- Objects
- Arrays intermediate/advanced methods
- Functions
- Test Driven Development

On each exercise's README.md there will be a short explanation of what there's to be done and a more datailed explanation on the learned topics.
